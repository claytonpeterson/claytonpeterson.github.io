    "description": "Minecraft had just come out when I first started learning to program, so procedural generation has always been an interesting topic to me. <br><br> I've made many implementations of a terrain generator over the years, and I am happy with my latest version. It uses a rust plugin to handle the heavy lifting - allowing for very fast terrain generation on the fly."
