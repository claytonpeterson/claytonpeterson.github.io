    "description": "At EveryRealm I worked on the early access game Hometopia. This project was a challenge because we had inherited a massive codebase that needed to be rewritten, while also producing regular feature updates. <br><br>My proudest contributions were: redesigning the store / item selection system, my work on the UI, and my rewrite of the locomotion system."
